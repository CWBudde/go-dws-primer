    "introduction": "As your programs grow, you'll want to organize your code into smaller, reusable pieces. **Procedures** help you do just that!\n\nA procedure is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You can call (execute) the procedure by name whenever you need that task done.\n\n### What You'll Learn\n- How to declare and define procedures\n- Calling procedures from your code\n- Why procedures make code more organized and maintainable\n- Best practices for naming and structuring procedures",

You've learned:\n\n- How to declare procedures using the `procedure` keyword\n- Defining procedure bodies with `begin` and `end`\n- Calling procedures by name\n- Reusing procedures to avoid code duplication\n- Organizing code into logical, named blocks\n\nProcedures are fundamental to writing clean, organized code. They help break down complex problems into manageable pieces!",
