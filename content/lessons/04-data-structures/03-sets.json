Unlike arrays, sets are unordered and automatically prevent duplicates.\n\nSets are perfect for checking membership, tracking options, and performing mathematical set operations.\n\n### What You'll Learn\n- Declaring and initializing sets\n- Adding and removing elements\n- Checking membership with the `in` operator\n- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)\n- Practical uses of sets",
